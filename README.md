## Explanation
This is a program that aids with the "great privitisation" (lol!) of Roblox assets that is forever being pushed forward by Roblox themself!
Recently, user uploaded assets such as animations, sounds, meshes etc. are set

- https://create.roblox.com/docs/projects/assets/privacy
- [Animation](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/public-animations/43299) ^btw this thread has been active since 2017 lol^
- [Audio](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/action-needed-upcoming-changes-to-asset-privacy-for-audio/1701697)
- ["meshes, meshparts, images/decals, models and packages"](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/limited-availability-beta-asset-privacy-and-permissions-for-meshes-images-and-models/3028931)

All of this has been done under the guise of preventing exploits, platform safety (and [200M$ lawsuits](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/music-publishers-sue-roblox-copyright-infringement-lawsuit/)!), but I believe this does more harm than good to developers on the platform and other creative induividuals.

For example, what if you want to make a creative piece of work themed around a game? Like a montage? You'd have to screen record the sounds, which in some cases can be impossible!
Roblox downloads audio files locally on the user's machine at `C:/<user>/AppData/Local/Temp/Roblox/sounds`, which can be played by appending the correct extension (typically `.ogg`) to the files.
This process is very long and tedious, and you don't know which sound is which! The folder is also prone to being filled chock full of *whatever* and works in mysterious ways!

## ADD IMAGE HERE LOLOL

> How might this tool be useful to the end user?
This tool will make getting sounds for whatever use (video editing, mods, your own games) much easier hopefully.
